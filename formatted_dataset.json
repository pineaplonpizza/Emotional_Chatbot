Selling certain items, like specialized pistols, allows developers to continue creating and maintaining the game.\n* **Rarity and Exclusivity:** Offering some guns for free and others for purchase can create a sense of rarity and exclusivity.

How should the chatbot respond?[/INS] That's a great question!  It really depends on a team's specific needs and strategy.  \n\n* **Focusing on the playoffs:** Drafting a player who can contribute immediately to a playoff push makes sense if a team is close.  \n\n* **Building for the future:** Selecting a late first-rounder who might need a year or two to develop could be attractive if the team is rebuilding and looking for long-term potential.  \n\nIt's a tough call with no easy answer.  What factors do you think are most important for a team to consider in this situation? \n\n </s>"
